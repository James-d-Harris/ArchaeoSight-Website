        <h2>Our Envisioned Solution</h2>
        <p>
            We will build a modified version of PlusPy, a TLA+ Python interpreter, that generates test sequences for NVMe SSDs based on random seeds and a given number of steps to take. This version of PlusPy will send and receive blocking callbacks to an NVMe CLI which will issue the NVMe commands to the device and receive the results of the commands. As development progresses, we will share additional details here.

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The rapid growth of <strong>Solid-State Drives (SSDs)</strong> in consumer and enterprise applications makes their reliability <strong>critical</strong>. 
                Traditional <strong>SSD validation</strong> relies on manually designed test plans, which <strong>fail to cover all possible failure scenarios</strong>.
                This results in <strong>inefficient testing, idle hardware, and undetected issues</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our project introduces <strong>Generative Testing</strong> using 
                <a href="https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html" target="_blank">TLA+</a>,
                a <strong>formal specification language</strong>, combined with <strong>PlusPy</strong>, a Python-based TLA+ interpreter, to generate and execute randomized 
                <strong>test sequences dynamically</strong> via <strong>NVMe commands</strong>. This improves <strong>test coverage, reduces bias, and ensures SSDs are tested more thoroughly</strong>.
            </p>

        <div class="motivation">
            <h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Current SSD validation faces major inefficiencies:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test plans are <strong>limited to predefined cases</strong>, leaving <strong>unknown failure conditions untested</strong>.</li>
                <li>Once test plans <strong>run out of cases</strong>, SSD hardware sits <strong>idle</strong>, wasting resources.</li>
                <li>Re-executing the <strong>same test plan</strong> does not improve test coverage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Our solution <strong>eliminates these inefficiencies</strong> by continuously generating <strong>new test sequences</strong> using TLA+ 
                specifications, ensuring SSDs undergo <strong>unanticipated conditions</strong>, leading to <strong>better bug detection</strong>.

            <h2>Project Impact</h2>
            <p>
                By <strong>automating test sequence generation</strong>, this system provides <strong>major advantages</strong>:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ðŸš€ <strong>Increases SSD test coverage</strong>, ensuring reliability beyond predefined test plans.</li>
                <li>ðŸ’° <strong>Reduces SSD idle time</strong>, improving resource utilization.</li>
                <li>ðŸ”„ <strong>Automates failure reproduction</strong>, simplifying debugging.</li>
                <li>ðŸŽ¯ <strong>Eliminates engineering bias</strong>, testing cases engineers may overlook.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The final <strong>codebase and documentation</strong> will be delivered to <strong>Western Digital</strong>, 
                ensuring future improvements and seamless integration into existing SSD validation pipelines.

            <p>
                The initial concept for this project was provided by our sponsor in the form of a 
                <a href="/documents/project_proposal.pdf" target="_blank">Capstone project proposal</a>. 
                This proposal outlined the <strong>motivation and initial ideas</strong> for generative SSD testing, which have 
                been <strong>refined through collaboration</strong> with Western Digital.
