            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>ArchaeoSight</strong> is a cross-platform mobile application built to assist archaeologists in the field by integrating data from pXRF spectrometers, GPS, and image analysis. It leverages <strong>machine learning</strong> to predict potential anthropogenic hotspots and enables <strong>offline-first functionality</strong> to ensure usability in remote locations. Developed in <strong>Flutter</strong> with <strong>TensorFlow Lite</strong>, ArchaeoSight aims to modernize how field data is collected, analyzed, and visualized.

            <h2>Problem & Motivation</h2>
            <p>
                Archaeologists today work with high-resolution data including elemental compositions, images, and GPS points. However, these technologies bring logistical issues:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Manual recording of data from specialized tools like <strong>pXRF devices</strong> is tedious and prone to error.</li>
                <li>Limited or no <strong>internet access</strong> at dig sites hinders data transfer and collaboration.</li>
                <li>There’s a need for <strong>real-time guidance</strong> on where to dig based on collected data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                ArchaeoSight resolves these by streamlining data input, offering offline support, and integrating ML-based hotspot prediction in a user-friendly mobile interface.

            <h2>Our Envisioned Solution</h2>
            <p>
                ArchaeoSight will offer photo capturing, GPS tracking, and support for uploading CSV exports from pXRF spectrometers. A lightweight ML model will run on-device to provide site predictions based on collected data. The app’s architecture will follow a <strong>stream-based offline-first model</strong> for robust performance, with synchronization via <strong>push notifications</strong> when online.

            <h2>Project Impact</h2>
            <p>
                ArchaeoSight provides a major step forward for field archaeology:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Identifies excavation hotspots</strong> based on real-time ML analysis.</li>
                <li><strong>Functions fully offline</strong> with seamless sync when online.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrates data</strong> from pXRF readings, GPS, and images for comprehensive insight.</li>
                <li><strong>Works on any modern mobile device</strong>, making it ideal for rugged fieldwork conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The system empowers archaeologists to spend less time managing data and more time making discoveries—bridging the gap between AI and anthropology.

            <h2>Original Project Proposal</h2>
            <p>
                The original project was proposed by <strong>Dr. Kayeleigh Sharp</strong>, who provided use-case data from her excavations at Huaca Letrada in Peru. The vision was refined in collaboration with our team, <strong>Jeevana Swaroop Kalapala</strong>, and further discussion with <strong>Dr. Sharp</strong>.
