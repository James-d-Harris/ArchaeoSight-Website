        <h2>Our Envisioned Solution</h2>
        <p>
            We will build a modified version of PlusPy, a TLA+ Python interpreter, that generates test sequences for NVMe SSDs based on random seeds and a given number of steps to take. This version of PlusPy will send and receive blocking callbacks to an NVMe CLI which will issue the NVMe commands to the device and receive the results of the commands. As development progresses, we will share additional details here.
